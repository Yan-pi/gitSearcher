# Git Searcher

Git Searcher is a web application that consumes the GitHub API to search for users, display information about them, and list their public repositories. This tool is useful for finding developer profiles and exploring their projects on GitHub.

## Features

- Search Users: Enter a GitHub username in the search bar and click "Search" to retrieve information about the user.
- Display User Information: After a successful search, you'll see details such as name, profile picture, number of followers, number of repositories, and more.
- List Public Repositories: Below the user information, you'll find a list of the user's public repositories with direct links to each of them.

## How to Use

1. Open [Git Searcher](https://git-searcher-three.vercel.app/) in your web browser.

2. In the search bar, enter the GitHub username you want to look up.

3. Click the magnifying glass icon to search.

4. After the search, you'll see user information and a button to view the list of public repositories.

## Technologies Used

- Vite: A fast build tool for front-end projects, optimizing development speed.
- React: A JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A JavaScript Superset that adds optional static typing, making the code more robust and secure.
- Axios: A library for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
- ShadCn/UI: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
- Prettier: A code formatting tool to keep the source code clean and organized.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a simple web application that demonstrates the integration of different technologies, such as React, TypeScript, Axios, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCn/UI. Using the GitHub API to fetch user and repository information is also an opportunity to learn about consuming external APIs, type definitions, interfaces, solidifying knowledge of hooks, and HTTP requests. Additionally, I took the opportunity to learn a new library of components.
